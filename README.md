Full-time jobs lead at 89%, remote work is limited to 15%, and nearly half of postings don’t require a degree, indicating an increase toward skills-based hiring. Benefits are limited, with only 10% mentioning health insurance, and most opportunities are concentrated on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed.
